# Crowd-sourced sheet music for any song, on any instrument. 

A community for music makers to find and share sheet-music transcriptions of their favorite songs. 

Want to know how to play Britney Spears' "Toxic" on the bassoon? Chances are some helpful violinist has already transcribed it. Just save the sheet music to your music folder, hit "transpose," and voila -- now you've got the sheet music for "Toxic" in bass clef.

Problem in the third measure? You can comment on a user's transcription to suggest edits. But be nice -- Scription runs on social currency. 

Each piece of sheet music you save to your music folder costs a little reputation. Your reputation will grow when others "like" your transcriptions or comments, so pitch in!
